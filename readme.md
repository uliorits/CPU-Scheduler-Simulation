# CPU Scheduler Simulator

A Python project to simulate CPU scheduling algorithms:
- First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin

## Features
- Define processes with PID, arrival time, burst time, priority.
- Calculate Waiting Time (WT), Turnaround Time (TAT), and Completion Time (CT).
- Compare scheduling algorithms and their metrics.


## Usage

Run the simulation:
```bash
python main.py
